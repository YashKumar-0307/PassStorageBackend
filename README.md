# Password Storage

### 1. Methodology:

The platform's frontend is created using ReactJS. The frontend performs fetch calls to the database to authenticate with the database and access the passwords table.
The database tables are hosted on MongoDB server and the backend is developed on NodeJS.

### 2. Description:

Passwords, these days, are required to be quite long and not very common to be very secure and difficult to hack. Hence, to make lives easier I have developed a platform where a user can create an account and store their passwords and view them anytime they want.

### 3. Input/Output:

The project asks the user to input the user credentials following which the user can access the existing entries and make new password entries.
